This application is a user management system built using Express.js, Sequelize ORM, and a relational database (MySQL). The application provides functionalities for user authentication and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users. It is designed to handle user roles and groups, making it suitable for applications requiring user access management and authorization.

Sure! Hereâ€™s the revised description without code blocks:

## **Express Authentication App**

### **Description**

This is a simple Express.js application that provides user registration and login functionality. It uses MySQL as the database for storing user information. The application allows users to register with a username, email, and password, and subsequently log in with their email and password.

### **Modules**

- **Express**: A web framework for Node.js, used to build the server and handle routing.
- **EJS**: An embedded JavaScript templating engine, used to render HTML views.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system, used to store and manage user data.
- **mysql2**: A MySQL client for Node.js, used to connect to and interact with the MySQL database.

### **Directory Structure**

- **`app.js`**: The main application file that sets up the Express server, middleware, and routes.
- **`config/db.js`**: The configuration file for connecting to the MySQL database. It sets up and exports the MySQL connection.
- **`routes/auth.js`**: Contains routes for user registration and login. Handles form submissions and interacts with the MySQL database to manage user data.
- **`views/`**: A directory containing EJS template files for rendering the registration and login forms.

### **Setup and Configuration**

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js and MySQL installed. Install the required npm packages by running `npm install express ejs mysql2`.

2. **Configure MySQL**:
   - Create a MySQL database named `express_auth`.
   - Create a `users` table with columns for `id`, `username`, `email`, and `password`.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Express server by running `npm start`.
   - Access the application at `http://localhost:3000/`.
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/register` to view the registration form.
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/auth/login` to view the login form.

### **Features**

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Allows users to log in using their email and password.
- **Form Validation**: Checks for required fields and password confirmation during registration.

### **Future Enhancements**

- **Password Hashing**: Implement password hashing (e.g., using `bcrypt`) for secure storage of passwords.
- **User Sessions**: Add session management to handle user authentication and keep users logged in.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and user feedback for better user experience.
